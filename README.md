Real Estate Platform Project: Introduction
This project is a full-fledged, modern online platform designed to digitize the property market, serving as a central marketplace where clients can efficiently search, filter, and request viewings, 
and owners can easily list and manage their properties. 
The platform aims to streamline communication and increase transaction transparency, replacing traditional manual processes with a seamless digital experience. 
It is built using a robust technology stack, featuring Angular for a dynamic user interface, ASP.net handling the API and business logic, and MySQL for scalable data management. 
This architecture ensures a fast, secure, and responsive application experience for all users.
